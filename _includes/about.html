  I'm a Master's Student at Purdue University's Daniels School of Business.
  Before this I worked as an Assistant Product Manager at American Express, where I worked on enhancements to Amex Digital Banking, 
  specifically Credit and Fraud Risk Management. Prior to that I worked as a Decision Aanlyst at ZS Assocaites, where I worked on 
  Healthcare Analytics, Sales Performance Analysis, Incentive Plan Design, and Incentive Compensation for a top Pharmaceutical 
  company - Bristoll Myers Squibb. I have a Bachelors in ECE from the SRM University, India.
  I love working with great people, getting creative with data, using state-of-the-art technologies and building awesome products.

      In a wide range of subject areas, I have analyzed structured and unstructured data to extract actionable business insights.
      I love to craft stunning and clever visualizations that illustrate surprising results.

      I'm strongly convinced that machine learning models should not go to waste in Colab Notebooks.
      Using my skills in the cloud, I've built and deployed ML/AI models in GCP which create real business value.

      I enjoy public speaking, writing professional articles, sharing my knowledge and discussing diverse topics.
      Thanks to my education and experience at a confluence of business and technology, I'm able to present complex results to both 
      technical and non-technical audience.
